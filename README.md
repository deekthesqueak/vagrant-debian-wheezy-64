## About

This script will:

 1. download the `Debian 7.6 "Wheezy"` server, 64bit iso
 2. ... do some magic to turn it into a vagrant box file
 3. output `wheezy64.box`

## Requirements

 * Oracle VM VirtualBox
 * Vagrant
 * mkisofs
 * 7zip

## Usage on OSX

    ./build.sh

This should do everything you need. If you don't have `mkisofs` or `p7zip`, install [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), then:

    brew install cdrtools
    brew install p7zip

To add `wheezy64.box` with name `debian-wheezy` into vagrant:

    vagrant box add "debian-wheezy" wheezy64.box

## Usage on Linux

    ./build.sh

This should do everything you need. If you don't have `mkisofs` or `p7zip`:

    sudo apt-get install genisoimage
    sudo apt-get install p7zip-full

To add `wheezy64.box` with name `debian-wheezy` into vagrant:

    vagrant box add "debian-wheezy" wheezy64.box

## Environment variables

You can affect the default behaviour of the script using environment variables:

    VAR=value ./build.sh

The following variables are supported:

* `PRESEED` — path to custom preseed file. May be useful when if you need some customizations for your private base box (user name, passwords etc.);

* `LATE_CMD` — path to custom late_command.sh. May be useful when if you need some customizations for your private base box (user name, passwords etc.);

* `VM_GUI` — if set to `yes` or `1`, disables headless mode for vm. May be useful for debugging installer;


### Notes

This script basted on original Carl's [repo](https://github.com/cal/vagrant-ubuntu-precise-64) and with some tweaks to be compatible Debian.
